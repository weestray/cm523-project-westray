          <p>Isabella Stewart Gardner was a Boston heiress, philanthropist, and patron of the arts renowned for her bold sense of style and unconventional behavior, which included:</p>
        <div class="biogrid">
          <ul>
            <li>smoking cigarettes in public</li>
            <li>showing up to the Boston Symphony Orchestra bearing a headband that declared, “Oh you Red Sox.” 
            </li>
            <li>inviting the Harvard Football team to her home after they beat Yale
            </li>
            <li>hosting a boxing match at her home and dancing while the men fought
            </li>
            <li>taking a toothless zoo lion on a stroll through a park</li>
          </ul>

          she once remarked, in response to gossip about her:</p>
          <blockquote>
            “Don’t spoil a good story by telling the truth.”
          </blockquote>
         <p>She was known for her love of literature, art, travels, and -- of course -- for her money. </p> </section>

        <h2 id="museumsectionlink">II. The Museum </h2>
        <p>With the help of local architect Willard T. Sears, Isabella’s museum -- modeled on the Renaissance palaces of Venice -- began construction in 1901.

          <p>In 1901 and 1902, Isabella installed her collection of paintings, sculptures, tapestries, furniture, manuscripts, rare books, and decorative arts. She continued to acquire works and change the installations for the rest of her life.</p>
        </div>
      </section>
      <section>
        <p>She supervised every aspect of the museum’s construction and design, ensuring it reflected her taste. At the time, her museum  was the largest collection of art by a private individual in America.
        </p>
        <p>She was incredibly particular about her museum; before it formally opened, she invited (blind) students from the Perkins School for the Blind to test the acoustics of a music room to preserve the secrecy.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          Gardner acquired and arranged each piece of art in the museum and then put it in writing that if anyone were to move anything, the museum would have to give everything to the MFA and shut down permanently.
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          The museum opened on January 1, 1903, with a celebration featuring champagne, donuts, and the Boston Symphony Orchestra.
Gardner mandated that it be free of charge, hoping to draw all of Boston. 
        </p>
      
        <p>Isabella filled her museum with artists, performers, and scholars. She was a dedicated patron of the arts and organized lectures, concerts, and exhibitions. </p>
        <p>A champion of artists and intellectuals, Gardner surrounded herself with creative minds, many of whom were gay—an affinity that some interpret as early advocacy for LGBTQ rights.</p>
        <p>She passed away in 1924, leaving the museum “for the education and enjoyment of the public forever.” </p>
        <h4>It would be foolish to assume that the story ends here. </h4>

          <h2> III. Sunday, March 18, 1990 </h2>
          <p>At 1:20 a.m., a vehicle pulled up by the side entrance of the museum.
          </p>
          <p>Two men in police uniforms rang the buzzer, connecting them to a security guard, 23-year-old Rick Abath. Through the intercom, they explained that they were investigating a disturbance and must be admitted into the museum.
          </p>
          <p>Abath buzzed them in.</p>
          <p>Within minutes, the “officers” had handcuffed Abath and the only other night guard. It is then that they said: </p>
        <blockquote>“Gentlemen, this is a robbery.”</blockquote>

          <p id="hidden-paragraph" hidden>Unfortunately, the two guards were unable to notify authorities due to the fact that the thieves wrapped duct tape around the guards’ heads and tied them up in the basement of the museum.</p>
          <p>Next, the thieves made their way through the museum.</p>
