            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>The Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston is known for its beautiful architecture and stunning art collection. But beyond this the legacy of its bold founder, Isabella Stewart Gardner, and culminates in the intrigue of the world's most valuable art heist.

        <h2 id="biosectionlink">I. WHO WAS ISABELLA STEWART GARDNER? </h2>
        <p>Isabella Stewart Gardner was a Boston heiress, philanthropist, hot topic in the gossip columns, and patron of the arts renowned for her bold sense of style and unconventional behavior, which included:

            <p>Isabella’s passion for collecting art began in the 1880s, sparked during extensive travels abroad with her husband, Jack. 
              They collected art everywhere from Europe to Asia; the works included stained glass, Renaissance art, Romanesque sculpture, and Chinese antiquities.
            </p>
          
            
            <p>Isabella and Jack’s art collection soon outgrew their house in Beacon Hill, so the couple decided to establish a gallery. However, Jack’s sudden death in 1898 left Isabella to carry their vision forward alone.</p>

        <div class="comparisongrid">
          <div class="sliderinstruct1">
            <p>With the help of local architect Willard T. Sears, Isabella’s museum -- modeled on the Renaissance palaces of Venice -- began construction in 1901.
              In 1901 and 1902, Isabella installed her collection of paintings, sculptures, tapestries, furniture, manuscripts, rare books, and decorative arts. 
              She was incredibly particular about every aspect of the museum’s construction and design, ensuring it reflected her taste. At the time, her museum  was the largest collection of art by a private individual in America.
      She continued to acquire works and change the installations for the rest of her life.

        <blockquote>
          Gardner acquired and arranged each piece of art in the museum and then put it in writing that if anyone were to move anything, the museum would have to give everything to the MFA and shut down permanently.
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          The museum opened on January 1, 1903, with a celebration featuring champagne, donuts, and the Boston Symphony Orchestra.
Isabella filled her museum with artists, performers, and scholars. She was a dedicated champion of artists and intellectuals and organized lectures, concerts, and exhibitions.
        She surrounded herself with creative minds, many of whom were gay—an affinity that some interpret as early advocacy for LGBTQ rights.</p>
        <p>She passed away in 1924, leaving the museum “for the education and enjoyment of the public forever.” </p>

          <p>At 1:20 a.m., a vehicle pulled up by the side entrance of the museum.

          <p>Two men in police uniforms rang the buzzer, connecting them to a security guard, 23-year-old Rick Abath. Through the intercom, they explained that they were investigating a disturbance and must be admitted into the museum.
            Abath buzzed them in.
          </p>
         
          

          
          <p>Within minutes, the “officers” had handcuffed Abath and the only other night guard. It is then that they said: <em>“Gentlemen, this is a robbery.”</em></p>
    
          <p>Unfortunately, the two guards were unable to notify authorities due to the fact that the thieves wrapped duct tape around the guards’ heads and tied them up in the basement of the museum.</p>
        
          <p>Next, the thieves made their way through the museum.</p>

<p>The FBI immediately began investigating, but the thieves – as you can probably imagine – covered their tracks quite well.

<div id='sketchframe'><img id="suspectsketches" src="/images/suspects-1024x740.jpg" alt=""></div>

<p>A few witnesses – leaving a St. Patrick’s Day Party around 12:30 a.m. – briefly observed the thieves, believing them to be policemen due to their disguises. The guards and witnesses in the street described one thief as around 5 feet 9 inches in his late 30s with a medium build, and the other as around  6 feet, in his early 30s with a heavier build.</p>
<p>Think carefully. Does this look like your grandfather or uncle who has a small room in his house that he's really cagey about?</p>

    All of these leads turned cold, and not a single arrest was ever made.
    <em>No one has seen the art since,</em> despite the $10 million reward offered by the museum for the items’ safe return.
  </p>
  <p> You might be wondering what someone can even do with a multi-million dollar painting. After all, it's not like you can display it in the center of your living room, unless all your relatives and guests are a) blind or b) devoid of a moral compass.

  <div id="whattodo">
  <h3>What you can do with a stolen painting!</h3>
    <ul id="paintingtut" >
    <li>Sell the art to a shady collector or dealer. The downside for a thief is that the going rate for a stolen work (according to Forbes) is somewhere in the range of 3-10% of the piece's actual value,
      and better-known pieces go for less.
    </li>
    <li><span>Extort money</span> from the museum itself – or a private owner or insurer who really wants their painting back. This is tactic called art-napping, which involves high-profile, unsellable pieces and requires a broker to navigate the fine line between legal and illegal dealings. 
    </li>

    <li><span>Currency in weapons and drug deals.</span> It's comparatively easier to move a small painting than a large suitcase of cash across borders.</li>
     <li>Throw it out, destroy it, or return it to the gallery. Seriously. This happens. For example, in 2003, three works by Picasso, Van Gosh, and Gauguin were stolen from the Whitworth Gallery in the U.K., and the thief left them in a public toilet a few days later.

<h2>A lot of things don't add up</h2>
  
<p>Some more food for thought:
  <ol>
    <li>The thieves took over $500 million worth of art, but left the museum's most expensive piece, "The Rape of Europa" by Titan. Why would they skip this piece? Some experts say it's because the painting was too large. Who knows.</li>
    <li>While they cut out the paintings – without a lot of care – they left one of the frames sitting in the security desk, instead of in the room it was taken. What's more surprising is that the motion detector never went off in this room.</li>
    <li> The last person of interest in the case, Mobster Robert "Bobby" Gentille – who police believed knew something about the paintings' whereabouts – passed away in 2021.</li>
<li> The thieves lost tried to remove a Napoleonic banner (of relatively little value) hanging above the entry to the Tapestry Room, which cost them a lot of time.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>In 2013, the FBI announced that it had identified the two thieves with a “high degree of confidence”: George Reissfelder and Leonard DiMuzio, two associates of the late mobster Carmello Merlino. But these two passed away less than a year after the heist, so it's not like we can ask them what they did with the paintings.
  </p>
  <p>The statute of limitations on all crimes related to the theft has expired, but that hasn't encouraged anyone to come forward. The museum even promises that "confidentiality is assured"!
  
  In recent years, the museum and FBI have continued to get tips. Many of those tips are from people who think they see the painting displayed in a Zillow listing – and they turn out to be reproductions – but you really never know. 
</p>
<p>The frames that held the missing artwork have sat empty since the robbery, and you can see them today.</p>
